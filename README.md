## General Information
- This WebApp was developed with the purpose of providing up-to-date and truthful information on technology at the same time that it was intended to teach the basics of some programming languages or technologies. 
- Technologies such as Java, Spring and Spring Boot were used due to the robust infrastructure they provide in the development of applications, likewise, these technologies have great labor demand and it was a project prepared as a final project in a subject of Web Applications and Patterns.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Netbeans IDE - version 13.
- Java - version 17 LTS (Long Term Support).
- Bootstrap - version 5.0.
- Spring Framework - version 5.
- MySQL - version 8.0.26.
- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Email Connection.
- Internationalization and few others.



## Features
- The login correctly validates the data so that the user can log in.
- The registration form works correctly, accounts/profiles can be created without problems.
- Internationalization works efficiently, you can switch between Spanish and English, of course more languages can be implemented later.
- All data is saved persistently through a database in this case MySQL.
- Good UI/UX practices were used for the development of the graphical user interface, using Bootstrap 5.0 and CSS3.
- The blog part serves correctly to keep abreast of technological trends.
- The contact form processes the request and sends the data to an email.

## Setup
The development environment is shaped by: 
- Netbeans IDE - version 13
- Java - version 17 LTS (Long Term Support)
- Bootstrap - version 5.0
- JQuery - version 3.2.1
- Other files for Bootstrap/JQuery they can be downloaded from here: 
- [Dependencies](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/)



## Usage
It's simple is just a WebApp with its functionalities


## Project Status
Project is: In Progress, the app is almost finished but the main functionality of learning programming lenguajes is not completed/working and maybe a profile user should be added in the near future too.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- The code for the blog handlers could be a lot better, it's inefficient due to the few minutes it took to add it, with time it can be a lot better.
- In the login and registration alerts should appear to correctly guide the user.

To do:
- Implement the main functionality of learning programming languages.
- Improve the blog section.
